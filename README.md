- **🌍 Physics Fun**  
  Adjust `self.gravity` for faster/slower ball movement. Perfect for setting difficulty levels!  

- **💎 Rewards System**  
  Modify the `self.rewards` list to change slot multipliers (e.g., `x10`, `x2`, `x0`).  

- **Brand Colors**  
  Match the UI to your brand's identity by updating obstacle, slot, and ball styles.
